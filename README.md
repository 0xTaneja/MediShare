# MediShare â€“ Secure Medical Record Sharing

_Major Overhaul in Progress_

This repo is the next-gen version of HealthCare: a full, patient-to-doctor file-sharing portal powered by IPFS (Pinata) and Netlify Functions.  We're currently cleaning up the template, adding Vite dev server, and wiring a secure backend.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Move static assets into `public/`
- [ ] Secure upload via Netlify Function (`upload.js`)
- [ ] Doctor portal to list files addressed to their ID (`getUploads.js`)
- [ ] Deploy to Netlify & add CI

Stay tuned!
